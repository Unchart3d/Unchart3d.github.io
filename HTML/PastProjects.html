    On the Calories Tracker page, users can input all the food they ate during the day and the corresponding calorie count. At the end of the day, they can hit the "End Day" button, which adds everything from that day to a summary list at the bottom and calculates the total calories.
    On the Progress page, users can set workout goals and track their current progress. The application will display their progression toward achieving those goals.
    On the Weight Tracker page, users can update the date and their current weight. These entries are plotted on a graph, which shows a visual summary of their weight changes over time.
    On the Workout Search page, users can browse a list of workouts, search for a specific workout, or look up exercises based on the muscle group they want to target.
    Finally, on the Workout Tracker page, users can select a day and log their workouts, including the number of sets and reps performed for each exercise.
