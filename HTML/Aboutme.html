    <h2>Hello I'm Ian Nichols</h2>
    <p>I'm a father and student studying computer science at Grand View University. I got an associates degree in Criminal Justice before
        moving to Iowa where I currently live. I am from Rochester MN and joined the military when I was 18. I served 4 years in the
        military working on the MQ-9's, loading munitions onto the aircraft and testing the launching system.</p>

<section class="journey">
    <p>My journey in programing started off in High school when I took a class called Principles of Engineering where we learned to code
    in python to control robots that we built in class. After that class the next time I had a programing class was when I was going
    for my Associates degree in Criminal Justice. I decided to take a web design class because I thought it would be really fun.
    Once I moved to Iowa with my wife, I was able to go back to school and I decided to pursue Computer Science. Since coming to
    Grand View and pursuing a degree in Computer Science, I have accomplished building many different apps like a ski rental app,
    a Pok√©mon app, workout tracker, etc. To see all my recent projects please see <a href="PastProjects.html">Past Projects</a></p>
